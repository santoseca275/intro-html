Day 2 of FEP (Front-End Programming)

Command Line & Git

Today's lesson covered the basics of the command line and it's terms.
Also, we learned how to create a repository and push a project via the terminal
to github.
The biggest thing is understanding the method linking to git in the Terminal
then getting your project prepared and pieced together through your text editor
via the Terminal, and getting it over to github.
